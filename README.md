Library of algorithms and data structures implemented in Scala language. I created this repository for educational purpose, mainly for myself. This is where I play and learn different kind of algorithms, data structures, concepts, techniques, etc in Scala. Most of the problems included are basics for now which I personally find them important. I plan to continue contributing more problems here in the future.
